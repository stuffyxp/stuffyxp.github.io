The channel is no exception!</p>

<p>On this edition of <strong>StuffyXP Wrapped</strong>, we’ll take a look at how the channel did + other things.</p>

<h1 id="the-yt-channel">The YT Channel</h1>

<p>The channel was pretty much dead between 2022 and 2023, due to no activity at all, staying at a mere 33 subscribers.</p>

<p>Then when 2024 came around, oh boy here come the changes!</p>

<p>I originally had the channel’s topic something different than tech (i did have some videos with TheCeleryPC but that’s about it), being uhhhhhh……plushies</p>
<h6 id="i-was-a-different-person-back-then-dont-judge-me-okay">I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON BACK THEN DON’T JUDGE ME OKAY</h6>

<p>That was also the time i joined Discord so i joined tech communities and yeah, it inspired me to make my own tech vids.</p>
<h6> </h6>
<p>The making of <a href="https://youtu.be/eKW6QilW3qo?si=KC6UaCUd2hqFZ2sF"><em>A VMware First-Timer installs Windows XP</em></a>  began back in January 14th (for the record it released on February 13th), it was def pain trying to get it done, i was using the famous <em>eMachines ET1810</em> (aka The Celery PC) so yeah, Celeron, videos, they don’t mix up do they~</p>

<p>Well they do, because on February 13th the video released after using a trillion OSes and having a faulty power outlet, after that i joined a couple of subs, reacching 50 subs right after, then i stopped for a bit until i made <strong>Installing Modern Programs on Windows Vista!</strong> and <strong>The Windows XP Vibes are here! - Whistler Beta 2</strong>.</p>

<p>After a lil’ break (mostly because of school), <strong>Is the Intel Pentium F00F bug possible in 86Box?</strong> released, being one of the videos i’m most proud of. Then after that i released <strong>Haiku - The modern implementation of BeOS</strong> (and the ReactOS video before that), and oh boy the Haiku video absolutely EXPLODED.</p>

<p>1K VIEWS IN LIKE 3 DAYS. WHAT THE FU-</p>

<p>Either way, i stopped.</p>

<p>I just didn’t really have the time to make new videos, i was finishing school and uh, in short the eMachines ET1810 fucking died (i’ll talk about it later), and then ay’ up! <strong>Geometry Dash… in Windows Vista!?</strong> got released after a 1 month haitus! It will sure won’t have any issues….right? RIGHT??!?</p>

<h3 id="the-gd-in-vista-drama">The GD in Vista drama</h3>

<p>This deserves it’s own section because oh my fucking god there were some dumb drama between YT and this video oh my god~</p>

<p>Basically the first time i published it it got taken down because “it showed people how to get games illegaly”, i put a GD 2.11 link, then i re-uploaded the video without that link, it didn’t get taken down during the premiere, good</p>

<p>THEN ONE FLIPPING DAY LATER THEY TOOK IT DOWN FOR THE SAME FUCKING REASON</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-12-31/takedown.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>^ that is from like 2 weeks ago dw.</p>

<p>I woke up to my TV saying “This video has been taken down due to violating YouTube’s Terms of Service”, i turned on my lappy and sure it was, a strike, then i spent the entire day trying to figure out a convincing appeal, if it weren’t, the video would be a lost case (and media as well).</p>

<p>But guess what, if it weren’t for the website’s homepage, this rare YT W is brought to you by a real person, baby!
How did i notice? Well uh its thanks to my TV again lmfao</p>

<p>I searched myself up for no reason and there it was, Geometry Dash on Windows Vista on the channel’s page, truly a legendary Pokemon to have, fuck Mew, fuck Ditto, THIS is a real legendary Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-12-31/rareytw.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>I still have a Warning but that will go away soon so i dont mind it.</p>

<p>As a lil’ christmas gift from yours truly, <strong>Using Windows 11 for the first time!</strong> released too for your viewing pleasure :3c</p>

<p>Either way it truly was an amazing year for the channel, the best for far one would say, over 100 subscribers (182 actually), and 10K total views, i would’ve never imagined that, thank you! :D</p>

<p>Oh i also gotta mention Stuffy 64 as well, that boi has 175 subs, amazing!</p>

<h3 id="the-celery-pc-status">The Celery PC Status</h3>

<p>Basically after an unexpected power cut, the computer suddenly powered on without me ever powering on the thing itself (it powered on on its own)</p>

<p>After some investigating with my dad, we eventually figured out that when the power came back, it overloaded the thing that gives DC making it no longer give DC, making some components unable to power on, things that needed AC like the fans worked just fine, after a month (aka when i came out of the haitus), my dad got me a new PC :D</p>

<p>So yeah R.I.P 2010 - 2024 eMachines ET1810-03 - <em>Your Celery moments were the best.</em></p>

<h1 id="the-website">The Website</h1>

<p>Well i gotta talk about the exact website you are on right now, stuffyxp.github.io innit?</p>

<p>Well it has truly been fun and unfun to code from scratch, from it’s quirks on iPads to me using the iPhone Sea (SE) to test the mobile side.</p>

<p>It has been around for a looooong while actually, since April 2024, it had alot of different versions, <a href="https://youtu.be/lT-vNY7-1lI?si=0XMUC8N01QyK5cUL">you can find the earliest one here</a>.
The one you are viewing right one is <strong>Version 2.1.1</strong>, but there is also version 1.0 (fun fact: v1.1 introduced codenames!)</p>

<p>It went from alot of styles, fun fact, the sequel!: the type of navbar is actually inspired from v0.1’s navbar.
Version 1.0 introduced tabs, similar to Lynxmic’s website at the time.</p>

<p>I have nothing more else to say here lmao.</p>

<h1 id="discord">Discord</h1>

<p>Not only has it been an amazing year to the YouTube channel, but to me in Discord as well, i met new people and made friends for the first time! (shocking)</p>

<p>I made two total Discord servers for the channel (<a href="https://discord.gg/5n8sDTR37v">invite</a>), joined many new communities and currently have the best friends and community i could ask for &lt;3</p>

<p>You can also have a chat with me over there! :D (it might take me some time tho as i have social anxiety xD)
Either way thanks for one amazing year on Discord too, hope to see more!</p>

<h1 id="fedi">Fedi</h1>

<p>(FYI Fedi is the network where clients like Mastodon connect to, they’re basically the same thing)
Of course i can’t not mention the social platform of all time, it’s gonna be my 1 year anniversary in 2 months :O</p>

<p>It has been one of my primary social media to stay on and i can’t thank anyone else enough for supporting me there for these months :D</p>

<p>I met new people too over there, such a lovely place!
(oh i forgot abt bluesky i recently joined that xD)</p>

<p>And well that’s it for today folks! Thanks for sticking around with for these months, if you’re still in 2024, enjoy the last hours of it, and if you’re in 2025, heya :3</p>

So this might seem weird but this silly mod can actually save your GD account from being compromised.
How you may ask? Keep reading to found out!</p>

<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>

<p>A few days ago i was playing Geometry Dash with other people via Globed, it’s basically 2.2’s delayed Versus mode made before RubRub even added it, then after going AFK for dinner, i came across the following message when coming back to my lappy…</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-12-15/globed-error.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100; height: auto;" />
Logged into my account in a different place?? What does that mean?</p>

<h1 id="the-hacking">The Hacking</h1>

<p>If you’ve been on the <strong>Minecraft</strong> community for a while, this may seem familiar to you.
<em>I was hacked.</em></p>

<p>Now, I was freaking out, i tried going into the <a href="https://www.boomlings.com/database/accounts/accountManagement.php">Account Management page</a> to try to change my password to no avail.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-notice">How did i notice?</h2>

<p>Well i’ll try to explain as best as i can.</p>

<p>When you use Globed for the first time, it will ask you if you agree for a bot to send you a message then delete it for aunthentication. If everything goes right, you’re in!</p>

<p>This method only happens locally, meaning that you will have to do it every single time you install Globed on a GD client, this does not transfer with Steam either.</p>

<p>Now, what happens when you aunthenticate on a new client while a client that already has an open session? (you may know the answer by now…)
It logs you out and let the new client in! Now it also gives you the prior warning that i showed you.</p>

<p>This is kinda similar to another incident in the Minecraft community, it just gives the same error as seen above.</p>

<h1 id="how-is-this-useful">How is this useful?</h1>

<p>By giving that warning, it advices you that someone else (a hacker) logged into your account, shoutout to the Globed team for adding this.</p>

<p>I emailed RobTop (<a href="mailto:support@robtopgames.com">via the support email</a>) about my compromised account not to found out a day later that i could reset my password via the previously mentioned account management page.
Which using that reset password method i should’ve changed my password for my main email as well-</p>

<p>Either way this is the end of this blog post, cya! ^^</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ay’ up!

<p>Ok so you’ve decided to get into video editng and YouTube video making and all that stuff with your good ol’ Windows Vista machine, great!!
<img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%201.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>You chose Camtasia Studio as your video editor, which has A BUILT-IN RECORDER FOR YOUR SCREEN?!?!?!?
(ok it’s not that deep but okay)</p>

<p>And when you’re about to film your “”"”tutorial””””, you get greeted by this error…</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%202.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>Well today i’m gonna walkthrough you on how to fix this annoying error (side note: this only happens on Windows Vista no matter what Service Pack you’re in, and it <em>only</em> happen on Vista, XP, 7 and up do not have this problem…)</p>

<p>On the desktop, press on your keyboard the keys (oh wow the irony lmao) Win + R, this should open up</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%203.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>As you can see i already have that path written, but be sure to write that in in the run box: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Program Files (x86)\TechSmith\Camtasia Studio 8</code></p>

<p>After that, select the following program, double-click it and click “Properties”</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%204.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p><em>image showing CamRecorder.exe being selected in Windows Explorer (sorry for the badly drawn arrow lmaooo)</em></p>

<p>After that, chose the “Compatibility” tab on the window and click “Show settings for all users” or smething similar (<em>sorry that it’s in Spanish i use(d to use) Spanish Windows…</em>)</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%205.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>Another window should open up, just tick the “Run this program as an administrator” checkbox, then click OK until you’re back to the Windows Explorer window</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%206.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>Then launch Camtasia Recorder as usual, and it should open up just fine, congratulations! you just fixed that one server referall error! :D</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-28/camrec8%207.JPG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>Now just continue your recording and video editing as usual!</p>

<p><em>Note: Applying the compatibility settings under Windows XP SP2 may also work, but it’ll lack audio support when recording, so this is better if you are recording something audio focused or anything else related to audio.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(this is just a filler post as i uploaded a video today, so why not give you guys some more stuffy content? :))]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/blog/img/2024-09-28/thumb.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/blog/img/2024-09-28/thumb.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Ubuntu Server experience.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/16/the-ubuntu-server-experience.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Ubuntu Server experience." /><published>2024-09-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/16/the-ubuntu-server-experience</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/16/the-ubuntu-server-experience.html"><![CDATA[<p>Well i have gotten again into what is the Linux world, and oh well it was kind of a hassle, today i’ll be telling you my experience with the GNOME-less/GUI-less Ubuntu, known as Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="the-prologue">The Prologue</h2>

<p>You may ask why did i even did this, well basically after running out of space on my Xubuntu install (for the 2nd time), i decided to try something different, as uh, the Xubuntu Minimal install is particularly broken, i couldn’t even manage my own account!</p>

<p>My Linux distro of choice is Ubuntu Server, 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish (i can’t run 24.04 my system is not compatible okay), as Canonical said on their downloads website, and i quote: “It will not install a graphical user interface.”, interesting, huh, i thought to myself, as we’re Debian all of a sudden again! - jokes aside i was kinda curious about this, as i won’t have to deal with GNOME anymore, and just install my favorite Linux DE: XFCE!</p>

<p>I used Unetbootin to add the Linux image to the Windows Boot Manager, booted it up and worked like a charm, i even managed to not clean my disk by accident since GParted was not present! :D</p>

<p>All of that aside, something went wrong, no it didn’t error out when installing, it just didn’t recognize my network “”””"”card””””””, basically it was a network USB, a “Belkin Wireless G USB Network Adapter F5D7050” to be exact, it did detect my Ethernet cards (yes, <em>cards</em>, idk why does the eMachines ET1810 have two Ethernet cards), i didn’t really think about it and just did the installation as usual, and no, this does not look like the Debian installer , it looks more nice and friendly in my opinion, anyways everything went well and i was network-less, and oh boy i wouldn’t know how of much a problem that would be…</p>

<h2 id="the-problems">The problems</h2>

<p>Everybody encounters issues when trying new things, i’m no exception! (as always haha).</p>

<p>As said earlier, networking was one of those problems, i tried everything to make it work, searched up a tutorial on YT, and it actually worked, i was just kind of an idiot when doing so, it worked like a charm tho, if not this website wouldn’t exist, anyway here’s some highlights of the shenanigans i went through.</p>

<h3 id="ubuntu-cli-and-wi-fi">Ubuntu CLI and Wi-Fi</h3>

<p>First of all, i installed some packages from <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com">the official Ubuntu packages website</a>, and unlike Microsoft, they actually had packages for older, unsupported releases! I went ahead and downloaded the WPA supplicant and some other dependencies, installed it and… no change, then i saw that you need to edit some .yml file located in “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/defualt/netplan</code>”, i opened it with GNU nano, and just added my device, configured it, added the SSID and password and used DHCP4, and it didn’t work… :/</p>

<p>It turned out that i edited the wrong file, i did it all again, and when i restarted it didn’t save for some reason, did it again and again for like 5 minutes, then in like the 16th time, i saw the verbose startup and …boom.. I saw “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">197.168.0.24</code>” as the IP address and finally, i had been connected, i don’t know what i did but Ubuntu finally decided to accept the settings! i pinged www.google.com (as every PC user would do, i think) and i recieved 64 bytes as a reply!</p>

<p>With networking out of the way, i had another problem…</p>

<h3 id="the-xfcexorgx11-shenanigans">The XFCE/Xorg/X11 shenanigans</h3>

<p>The network configuration was done. Perfect. Now what?</p>

<p>Well i certainly not gonna use a command-line-interface for Linux the entire time so i went ahead and with my newly configured network, to install an X11 server!
I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install (some command here i don't remember what installed x11 lmao)</code> to get up and running X11, execpt it didnt really work… then i decided to get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xubuntu-desktop</code> and it didnt work either, it opened but crashed on startup.</p>

<p>I saw a tutorial on how to get XFCE 4.16, ran the ansible-playbook (since it required it), but before that i got some files from that person’s website (the tutorial said so so don’t worry), i opened but required my SSH password… yeah i didn’t know how to get that…</p>

<p>I tried with my own user’s password, it didn’t work, i tried the root passowrd, it didn’t work either, at this point i didn’t know what else i could try so i just gave up, and no i didn’t delete the partition dw.</p>

<p>Then, after a restart (since i wanted to do show something funny on Windows, the pic below is what i wanted to show), then i rebooted back into Ubuntu and… i got what i wanted… almost.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-16/winpic.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
<em>Windows 7 Disk Management window letting me assign a letter, shrink and mount the Linux volume, which does not happen with other distros I had around (this did not happen with Xubuntu), prob happened since I first used that volume as FAT32 then used it in the installer so I wouldn’t get confused lmao</em></p>

<p>For some reason it installed GNOME instead of XFCE, i had a GUI, yay i guess, then everything went straightfoward, i opened the terminal, ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install xfce4</code> and done, XFCE was installed, i just needed to make it the defualt session.</p>

<p>It took me a while on how to login into XFCE but then i just did and done! XFCE 4.16 was installed and worked like a charm!
Then i went on to customize the panels a bit, making the bottom one (where the launchers are located) to make a sort of a “macOS Dock”, and the top one where for everything else, workspaces, time &amp; date, user thingy, apps menu, window menu, etc.</p>

<p>Then i grabbed some apps, i got Firefox 130 and VS Code from Snap (ik everybody hates that but that’s the only way to get those apps okay?), grabbed Ruby-Lang from APT, installed Jekyll &amp; Bundler, and installed VMware 12 from <a href="https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/12.0.0/2985596/linux/core">here</a> and installed it, it worked, suprisingly!</p>

<p>And well, everything is done, here’s the end result!</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2024-09-16/result.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well after this rollercoaster of shenanigans, everything worked out, and i learned alot about Linux itself, that’s a win-win situation for me!
Now with a working development enviroment, expect more of this soon, new experiences, new shenanigans, new blog posts!</p>

<p>Oh, and also welcome to the new website! Have a great day!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well i have gotten again into what is the Linux world, and oh well it was kind of a hassle, today i’ll be telling you my experience with the GNOME-less/GUI-less Ubuntu, known as Ubuntu Server.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/blog/img/2024-09-16/thumb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/blog/img/2024-09-16/thumb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
