Ay' up! So this might seem weird but this silly mod can actually save your GD account from being compromised.
How you may ask? Keep reading to found out!

# Prologue

A few days ago i was playing Geometry Dash with other people via Globed, it's basically 2.2's delayed Versus mode made before RubRub even added it, then after going AFK for dinner, i came across the following message when coming back to my lappy...

Logged into my account in a different place?? What does that mean?

# The Hacking

If you've been on the **Minecraft** community for a while, this may seem familiar to you.
*I was hacked.*

Now, I was freaking out, i tried going into the [Account Management page](<https://www.boomlings.com/database/accounts/accountManagement.php>) to try to change my password to no avail.

## How did i notice?

Well i'll try to explain as best as i can.

When you use Globed for the first time, it will ask you if you agree for a bot to send you a message then delete it for aunthentication. If everything goes right, you're in!

This method only happens locally, meaning that you will have to do it every single time you install Globed on a GD client, this does not transfer with Steam either.

Now, what happens when you aunthenticate on a new client while a client that already has an open session? (you may know the answer by now...)
It logs you out and let the new client in! Now it also gives you the prior warning that i showed you.

This is kinda similar to another incident in the Minecraft community, it just gives the same error as seen above.

# How is this useful?

By giving that warning, it advices you that someone else (a hacker) logged into your account, shoutout to the Globed team for adding this.

I emailed RobTop ([via the support email](<mailto:support@robtopgames.com>)) about my compromised account not to found out a day later that i could reset my password via the previously mentioned account management page.
Which using that reset password method i should've changed my password for my main email as well-


Either way this is the end of this blog post, cya! ^^
