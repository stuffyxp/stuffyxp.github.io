Oh boy it has sure been a hell of a ride this year innit? The channel is no exception!

On this edition of **StuffyXP Wrapped**, we'll take a look at how the channel did + other things.

# The YT Channel

The channel was pretty much dead between 2022 and 2023, due to no activity at all, staying at a mere 33 subscribers.

Then when 2024 came around, oh boy here come the changes!

I originally had the channel's topic something different than tech (i did have some videos with TheCeleryPC but that's about it), being uhhhhhh......plushies
###### I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON BACK THEN DON'T JUDGE ME OKAY

That was also the time i joined Discord so i joined tech communities and yeah, it inspired me to make my own tech vids.
###### &nbsp;
The making of [*A VMware First-Timer installs Windows XP*](<https://youtu.be/eKW6QilW3qo?si=KC6UaCUd2hqFZ2sF>)  began back in January 14th (for the record it released on February 13th), it was def pain trying to get it done, i was using the famous *eMachines ET1810* (aka The Celery PC) so yeah, Celeron, videos, they don't mix up do they~

Well they do, because on February 13th the video released after using a trillion OSes and having a faulty power outlet, after that i joined a couple of subs, reacching 50 subs right after, then i stopped for a bit until i made **Installing Modern Programs on Windows Vista!** and **The Windows XP Vibes are here! - Whistler Beta 2**.

After a lil' break (mostly because of school), **Is the Intel Pentium F00F bug possible in 86Box?** released, being one of the videos i'm most proud of. Then after that i released **Haiku - The modern implementation of BeOS** (and the ReactOS video before that), and oh boy the Haiku video absolutely EXPLODED.

1K VIEWS IN LIKE 3 DAYS. WHAT THE FU-

Either way, i stopped.

I just didn't really have the time to make new videos, i was finishing school and uh, in short the eMachines ET1810 fucking died (i'll talk about it later), and then ay' up! **Geometry Dash... in Windows Vista!?** got released after a 1 month haitus! It will sure won't have any issues....right? RIGHT??!?

### The GD in Vista drama

This deserves it's own section because oh my fucking god there were some dumb drama between YT and this video oh my god~

Basically the first time i published it it got taken down because "it showed people how to get games illegaly", i put a GD 2.11 link, then i re-uploaded the video without that link, it didn't get taken down during the premiere, good

THEN ONE FLIPPING DAY LATER THEY TOOK IT DOWN FOR THE SAME FUCKING REASON

^ that is from like 2 weeks ago dw.

I woke up to my TV saying "This video has been taken down due to violating YouTube's Terms of Service", i turned on my lappy and sure it was, a strike, then i spent the entire day trying to figure out a convincing appeal, if it weren't, the video would be a lost case (and media as well).

But guess what, if it weren't for the website's homepage, this rare YT W is brought to you by a real person, baby!
How did i notice? Well uh its thanks to my TV again lmfao

I searched myself up for no reason and there it was, Geometry Dash on Windows Vista on the channel's page, truly a legendary Pokemon to have, fuck Mew, fuck Ditto, THIS is a real legendary Pokemon.

I still have a Warning but that will go away soon so i dont mind it.

As a lil' christmas gift from yours truly, **Using Windows 11 for the first time!** released too for your viewing pleasure :3c

Either way it truly was an amazing year for the channel, the best for far one would say, over 100 subscribers (182 actually), and 10K total views, i would've never imagined that, thank you! :D

Oh i also gotta mention Stuffy 64 as well, that boi has 175 subs, amazing!

### The Celery PC Status

Basically after an unexpected power cut, the computer suddenly powered on without me ever powering on the thing itself (it powered on on its own)

After some investigating with my dad, we eventually figured out that when the power came back, it overloaded the thing that gives DC making it no longer give DC, making some components unable to power on, things that needed AC like the fans worked just fine, after a month (aka when i came out of the haitus), my dad got me a new PC :D

So yeah R.I.P 2010 - 2024 eMachines ET1810-03 - *Your Celery moments were the best.*


# The Website

Well i gotta talk about the exact website you are on right now, stuffyxp.github.io innit?

Well it has truly been fun and unfun to code from scratch, from it's quirks on iPads to me using the iPhone Sea (SE) to test the mobile side. 

It has been around for a looooong while actually, since April 2024, it had alot of different versions, [you can find the earliest one here](<https://youtu.be/lT-vNY7-1lI?si=0XMUC8N01QyK5cUL>).
The one you are viewing right one is **Version 2.1.1**, but there is also version 1.0 (fun fact: v1.1 introduced codenames!)

It went from alot of styles, fun fact, the sequel!: the type of navbar is actually inspired from v0.1's navbar.
Version 1.0 introduced tabs, similar to Lynxmic's website at the time.

I have nothing more else to say here lmao.

# Discord

Not only has it been an amazing year to the YouTube channel, but to me in Discord as well, i met new people and made friends for the first time! (shocking)

I made two total Discord servers for the channel ([invite](<https://discord.gg/5n8sDTR37v>)), joined many new communities and currently have the best friends and community i could ask for <3

You can also have a chat with me over there! :D (it might take me some time tho as i have social anxiety xD)
Either way thanks for one amazing year on Discord too, hope to see more!

# Fedi

(FYI Fedi is the network where clients like Mastodon connect to, they're basically the same thing)
Of course i can't not mention the social platform of all time, it's gonna be my 1 year anniversary in 2 months :O

It has been one of my primary social media to stay on and i can't thank anyone else enough for supporting me there for these months :D

I met new people too over there, such a lovely place!
(oh i forgot abt bluesky i recently joined that xD)

And well that's it for today folks! Thanks for sticking around with for these months, if you're still in 2024, enjoy the last hours of it, and if you're in 2025, heya :3

*Oh also if you got ALL the references in the thumbnail, you're a fucking legend.*

Catch the stuff, and pass it on, StuffyXP out.
